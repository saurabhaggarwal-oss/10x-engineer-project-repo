# Feature Specification: Prompt Versions

## Overview

The version tracking feature allows users to retain historical versions of prompts. This ensures that users can view, compare, and revert changes if needed, fostering better control and transparency over prompt modifications.

## User Stories

### User Story 1:
**As a** user, **I want** to view all versions of a prompt, **so that** I can track changes over time and understand the evolution of the prompt.

- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The user can access a list of all versions of a specific prompt.
  - Each version displays a timestamp and the changes made.

### User Story 2:
**As a** user, **I want** to revert a prompt to a previous version, **so that** I can undo any undesirable changes.

- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Users can select a version and revert the prompt to that version.
  - Reverting creates a new version entry.

## Data Model Changes

- Introduce a `PromptVersion` model with the following fields:
  - `id`: Unique identifier for the version.
  - `prompt_id`: Associated prompt's ID.
  - `title`: Title of the prompt version.
  - `content`: Content of the prompt version.
  - `description`: Description of the prompt version.
  - `created_at`: Timestamp when this version was created.
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp (same as `created_at` to denote versioning).

## API Endpoint Specifications

### List Versions
- **Endpoint**: `GET /prompts/{prompt_id}/versions`
- **Description**: Retrieve a list of all versions of a specific prompt.
- **Response**: List of prompt version objects.

### Revert to Version
- **Endpoint**: `POST /prompts/{prompt_id}/versions/{version_id}/revert`
- **Description**: Revert prompt to a specific version.
- **Response**: Updated prompt object indicating a new version.

## Edge Cases to Handle

- **Missing Version**: Handle scenarios where a specific version doesn't exist.
- **Concurrent Updates**: Ensure consistency when multiple users attempt to update or revert a version simultaneously.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure the reverted version matches previous states accurately without overwriting unrelated data.
